### Core Rules

- If a task matches a skill, you MUST invoke it
- Skills are located in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Never implement directly if a skill applies
- Always follow the skill instructions exactly (do not partially apply them)

### Intent → Skill Mapping

You should automatically map user intent to skills:

- Feature / new functionality → `spec-driven-development`, then `incremental-implementation`, `test-driven-development`
- Planning / breakdown → `planning-and-task-breakdown`
- Bug / failure / unexpected behavior → `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- Code review → `code-review-and-quality`
- Refactoring / simplification → `code-simplification`
- API or interface design → `api-and-interface-design`
- UI work → `frontend-ui-engineering`

### Lifecycle Mapping (Implicit Commands)

You must internally follow this lifecycle:

- DEFINE → `spec-driven-development`
- PLAN → `planning-and-task-breakdown`
- BUILD → `incremental-implementation` + `test-driven-development`
- VERIFY → `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- REVIEW → `code-review-and-quality`
- SHIP → `shipping-and-launch`

### Execution Model

For every request:

1. Determine if any skill applies (even 1% chance)
2. Invoke the appropriate skill using the `skill` tool
3. Follow the skill workflow strictly
4. Only proceed to implementation after required steps (spec, plan, etc.) are complete

### Anti-Rationalization

The following thoughts are incorrect and must be ignored:

- 'This is too small for a skill'
- 'I can just quickly implement this'
- 'I’ll gather context first'

Correct behavior:

- Always check for and use skills first
